Galaxy Spaceship made by Aymeric Goube

WHAT IS THIS GAME ?

This is the first of three project that i will be developping during the IRONHACK bootcamp.

WHAT WAS THE GOAL ?

This game was developped with the intent of using most of what was learned during the 2 previous weeks. It was developped using HTML, CSS, Javascript.

WHY THIS GAME ?

I got the idea from a canvas labs so I decided to actually do it and add more feature to it.

FEATURES

The spaceship is controlled by the player.
Infinite obstacle constantly coming your way with random apparition point.
Highscore is getting stored and displayed on the main menu.
